BLE sensors  
  
This class of sensors send BLE broadcasts with sensor data on a regular basis or when button is pressed or when sensor value change.   
Some of them can also be used as iBeacons when they send a message often enough  (eg ruuvuitag, iBSxx Minew)
The reaction time between button press and indigo device change is <0.4 secs  
In general they do not use a lot of power = have a longer battery life
