Added features / changes in v7.105.285 @ 2019-06-13
===================================================

1. fixed "error in Line 513 has error=global name 'wifiIP' "


"

Added features / changes in v7.105.284 @ 2019-06-13
===================================================

1. fixed some code and menus for select wlan/eth on raspberry 

2. added option to sitwch on fan when RPI internal temp is > xx C
   in addtion to any external temp sensor 
   this is set in RPI device edit

3. now warnings are also printoed into the standard indigo logfile, was send only to pibeacon.log file before

4. when the RPI boots it check if the "dirty bit was on (ie shutdown = simple power off)"
   when after boot the dirty bit is still on the plugin will get a message ( shown in the logfile)

6. increase wait time for proper start of tcpip stack to > 75 secs from 65 secs. should always work after 25 secs.
   but some slower MAC might take a little longer

7. change error message when tcpip stack does not strat properly to something meaingfull beside error in line ..

8. changed log message when sending data to rpi and it is not accepting commands while rebooting to a simple warning, not error



Added features / changes in v7.105.283 @ 2019-06-13
===================================================

1. added option to select wlan/ eth on rpasberry 
    switch wlan/eth : on / off / on if other off/ do not change
    useIP# use / do not use / use if other off/
       this is the IP # send to the plugin to ID the device
    the default is 
      eth : do not change, useIP#
      wlan: on if eth off, useIP if eth off
== this was added to cover: wifi is used for comm to indigo and eth for another subnet

2. fixed pibeacon utils format error

general setting is done in config, as soon as the rpi is edited the device edit setting is used.



Added features / changes in v7.105.280 @ 2019-05-08
===================================================

1. added option to show BLEconnect devices on location plot.
   you need to set options (color, name etc) in devcie edit.

2. fixed some code inconsistencies after running code inspec w pycharm.
   and found some bugs, but only when exceptions occur = not under normal operations
   hence they do not show up frequently

3. remove old style version check, now depends on indigo to do version checking (7.3 and higher)


Added features / changes in v7.104.279 @ 2019-05-08
===================================================

1. moved setGPIO command into execcommands. that reduces delay with older RPI ie RPI1
   and do not send back status to indigo if not requested

2. now all pibeacon logfiles on the RPI are in ONE file: /var/log/piBeacon.log
it looks like:

Added features / changes in v7.103.275 @ 2019-05-06
===================================================

1. fixed  SPRINKLER relay to be on if GPIO is 0 or 1 


Added features / changes in v7.103.274 @ 2019-04-30  
===================================================

1. added option for SPRINKLER relay to be on if GPIO is 0 or 1 
	set in device edit.

2. some typos in menus


Added features / changes in v7.103.274 @ 2019-02-20  
===================================================

1. added check at startup in case indigo device was deleted while pibeacon was not running



Added features / changes in v7.103.273 @ 2019-02-20  
===================================================

1. fixed plot beacons
	wrong test for xposition, was tested against Ymax not Xmax

2. moved plot beacon position to regular plugin.log file 

3. absolute position rotary switches with Serial input now support 6...12 bits resolution



Added features / changes in v7.103.272 @ 2019-02-10:  
===================================================

1. finalized rotaty encoded switch devices
	A absolute position
		read encoded n pin rotaty switch, send integer value to indogo every 90 secs or if changed
		grey code = only 1 bit changes pre step
		    eg http://www.grayhill.com/assets/1/7/mech_encoder_26.pdf
		regular binary; normal binary code 
		   like also: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071F4QM6L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1
		Bourns table encoded: 
			special bourns devices that comes with an 8 bit 0-127 value encoding
			    https://www.bourns.com/pdfs/ace.pdf
			    pins 1,2,G,,3,4   8,7,G,6,5 
				0-127 positions

		Bourns serial evice that is read like SPI, but just very simple code
			    CLK, CS, DO= read data. it is 10 bits + some status bits
			    pins: Di,CLK, GND, DO, V+, CS
			    https://www.bourns.com/pdfs/EMS22A.pdf
				0-1023 positions


	B continuous increment / decrement 
		"2-bit quadrature code" using 2 GPIO pins and GND and V+
		2 gpios are read. they go 1 0 1 0 .. most have 0=ON and 1 = off
		B: 011001100110
		A: 001100110011
		and opposit direction:
		B: 001100110011
		A: 011001100110 
		one full step is 4 bits

2. BUG fix for DHT temp sensor
	screw up in one of the last versions when I switch from 2 different DHT to one type

3. Made version check future proof

4. changed logging for errors or init of dataStats file




Added features / changes in v7.101.271 @ 2019-02-04:  
===================================================

1. added  save / reset for INPUT rotary increments devices
	at each start old values are read and saved to SSD when they changed.
	indigo menu option can send  reset command to the RPi to rotary switch counters 


Added features / changes in v7.101.270 @ 2019-02-04:  
===================================================

1. added lookup of mac to vendor name for ibeacons, added state "vendorName"

2. some smaller debugs

3. added check if userid / password not set: will write message and wait before doing anything  

4. converted to std logging

5. added sensor type: 
	INPUT-Rotatary-switch-Grey-Pulses : supports turn switches that send grey encoded pulse left and right direction
	INPUT-Rotatary-switch-encoded: supports turn switches that have static codes at n Pins that deliver 4.8.16... states from binary pins values

6. did a lot of testing and added little fixes when creating / deleting RPIs


Added features / changes in v7.100.269 @ 2019-01-25:  
===================================================

1. added time windows < 3 secs where status can not change up/down/up/down

2. added more options for stepper motor  
 - stepper motor ON time after move
 - wait before and after step loop


Added features / changes in v7.100.269 @ 2019-01-25:  
===================================================

1. fixed:  BLE connect up/down/up when iphone is off.

2. fixed:  some logging inconsistencies, typos... 

3. added support for various STEPPER MOTORS
You can chose between 5 pole unipolar and 2 coils bipolar stepper motors.  
These motors must be driven by chips:    
ULN2003 is a simple set of darlington transitors, current up to 250mA. It is used for the 5 pole unipolar motor   
L9110 low power and L298N high power: can be used to drive bipolar 2 coil motors in full and half step modes  
A4988 (8V-35V) and DRV8834(2.5V-8V) are more sophisticated.   
-They are almost 100% pin compatible
-Can drive bipolar 2 coil motors in 1,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16 (and 1/32) step size you need to configure the pins on the chips to set the step size
-Can configure enable / sleep / reset and fault pins. They are currently only used to switch the motor ON at start,
      but you could also simply hardwire the pins at the chip directly. You should be able to use multiple motors on the same RPI, just limited by the number of GPIOs available
Use an indigo ACTION  "Send commands to stepper motor .." to drive the motor; #of steps, direction, delays ... can be send in single or multiple sets
You can use up to 3 GPIO input pins to control the range of the motor:  
   If one of thes GPIO goes High/low the motor will stop. This can be enabled / configured in each action separately. 
   In device edit you define the GPIO pin numbers and refer to them in actions as GPIO#0 / 1 / 2



Added features / changes in v7.99.266 @ 2019-01-08:  
===================================================

1. fixed:  sself.log.. should be  self.log... -- typo in 2 places. Only happens when error occurs and error is logged 


Added features / changes in v7.99.265 @ 2019-01-07:  
===================================================

1. fixed: 1. wlan0 not working, logging not working

Added features / changes in v7.99.263 @ 2019-01-06:  
===================================================

1. added support for wlan1 in addition to wlan0. in case you have 2 wifi adapters. BUT ONLY one can be active

2. moved all pibeacon files from ~/indigo/pibeacon to  /Library/Application Support/Perceptive Automation/Indigo 7.2/Preferences/Plugins/com.karlwachs.piBeacon/

3. all detailed logging now goes to /Library/Application Support/Perceptive Automation/Indigo 7.2/Logs/com.karlwachs.piBeacon/plugin.log. all error messages still go to teh standard indigo logfile

4. fixed bug line 4649 in buttonAnycommandCALLBACK bad operand... . only occures when sending custom command to rpi and logging was switched on

5. suppressed some RPi updating messages

A
Added features / changes in v7.99.262 @2018-12-28 :  
===================================================

1. renamed  dev state closestRPItext to closestRPIText to make it constant with previous name


Added features / changes in v7.99.261 @ 2018-12-28:  
===================================================

1. added support for sensors:
	- adafruit max31865 platinum 100/1000 temp sensor
	- adafruit  tmp007 remote temperature sensor,  successor to temp006


2. added back dev state closestRPItext for iBeacons:
	this dev state now shows the NAME of the closest RPI, not just PI_x
	also added option in config to set closestRPItext to blank when iBeacon leaves or keep the last RPI name



Added features / changes in v7.98.258 @ 2018-12-14:  
===================================================

1. bug fix for RPI beaconloop.py program - only a problem when BLE program was not working properly ie in restart: 
	return argument was mixed up, was introduced in 7.98.255 

2. added check for MAC mac number returned from RPI in plugin- in case of empty messages ... 

3. added RPI devices states: last_boot, rpi_type, op_sys to give you a quick view of the state and config of your RPIs.
	Useful if you have many RPi

4. Improved devices edit menus for RPi and iBeacon sensors

5. fixed reboot ssh command, was not always working 


===================================================

1. added clostedRPI state to RRPI devices. Was only in iBeacons devices


Added features / changes in v7.98.256 @ 2018-12-10:  
===================================================

1. clean up GPOIO output and inverse settings. the inverse as well as initial state are now shown in device states


Added features / changes in v7.98.255 @ 2018-12-09:  
===================================================

1. added option in RPI device edit to select which BLE channel should be used for iBeacon / BLEconnect.
	RPI3+ with SSD >=2018-11 does not work properly with the internal chip, 
	Must add an external USB dongle for iBeacon. BLE connect works fine w internal BLE chip.

2. added option to DELETE RPI in "initial setup of RPI" in the plugin menu, besides "ON/off".
	this is useful if you interchange RPi or want to get rid of any RPI config for a specific RPI. 
	
3. A RPI device will now be created when setting up a new RPi in "initial setup of RPI".
	the plugin does not wait for the first iBeacon message to create the RPI.
	The RPi will be initiated with MAC# 00:00:00:00:00:00. When the first iBeacon message arrives from the RPI that MAC number is overwritten 
	This is needed in order to be able to set the BLE device that should be used for iBeacon (for RPI3plus you need to set the BLE for iBeacon to USB)
	When the proper BLE device is not selected no iBeacon message are send from the RPI

4. added a log message when ftp to RPI is successfully finished (when Update RPI debug is on). Before only the start was put into the log file

5. increased some timers on the RPI python files to make sure that if something goes wrong and its in "panic" mode  it is not constantly rebooting, but wait 30+ secs between reboots.
	(I had that problem.)

These changes should now enable the usage of "SSD stretch image 2018-11" ... BUT the RPI3plus will need an extra BLE dongle to work. 
With "SSD stretch image 2018-04" RPI3plus works fine.




Added features / changes in v7.97.253 @ 2018-12-08:  
===================================================

1. fixed wrong trigger labels 


Added features / changes in v7.97.252 @ 2018-12-06:  
===================================================

1. option to set sleep/wait time after boot (in RPI device edit), before master.py starts.   
	This is useful for #2 and can be tuned to accommodate to let eg wifi connect before master.py is started  
	rc.local calls /home/pi/callbeacon.py, it then waits xx secs before it calls /home/pi/pibeacon/master.py  

2. option to set 2 GPIO  (input or output) to any value (in/out, low, high, floating .,..) BEFORE master.py immetiately after rc.local is finished (set in RPI device edit)  
	this is useful to set a GPIO as fast as possible after boot before all networks, vars, etc are finished.. saves ~ 15 secs  
	done in /home/pi/pibeacon/doGPIOatStartup.py called by /home/pi/callbeacon.py  ..called by rc.local after boot  
	doGPIOatStartup is setup by master with the options set in RPI device edit  

3. added state "actualGpioValue" to OUTPUT-GPIO on/off devices.  
	This will set the actual value of the GPIO on the RPI, msg send from rpi to the plugin.   
	It will be refreshed after GPIO is set from plugin and checked every 90 secs or if changed   
	useful if your GPIUO is set by other means or after a reboot the GPIOs might not be set properly  

4. added RPI device state "closest iBeacon". it will show eg b-xy-volvo-keys-turcoise@0.2 = name@distance.
	you can set cutoff distance (ignore if distance > xx) in PRI device edit
	you can set ignore THIS iBeacon for this feature in iBeacon device edit.
	how to use it in an action (python code), trigger on any chage of dev/state
		yyyy = indigo.devices["name of your rpi"].states
		xxx = yyyy["closestiBeacon"]
		if xxx.find("@")>-1:  
			nameOfBeacon = xxx.split("@")[0]
			distToRPI    = float(xxx.split("@")[1])
			indigo.server.log(" closest beacon to RPi is "+nameOfBeacon+" at distance of "+str(distToRPI))
			# do something with dist
			if distToRPI < 3: 
				indigo.server.log("beacon is very close" )
		else:
			indigo.server.log("no iBeacon is close" )
   

5. added option in menu to restart master.py in case it hangs ... 


x. will deprecate devices OUTPUT-GPIO-4,8,12,16,.. should all be changed to device type OUTPUT-GPIO-1-on-off
	it is to complicated to manage all the states and which one to use for status and is more in line with std Indigo philosophy
