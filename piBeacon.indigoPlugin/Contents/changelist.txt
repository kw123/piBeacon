Added features / changes in v7.97.253 @ 2018-12-08:  
===================================================

1. fixed wrong trigger labels 


Added features / changes in v7.97.252 @ 2018-12-06:  
===================================================

1. option to set sleep/wait time after boot (in RPI device edit), before master.py starts.   
	This is useful for #2 and can be tuned to accommodate to let eg wifi connect before master.py is started  
	rc.local calls /home/pi/callbeacon.py, it then waits xx secs before it calls /home/pi/pibeacon/master.py  

2. option to set 2 GPIO  (input or output) to any value (in/out, low, high, floating .,..) BEFORE master.py immetiately after rc.local is finished (set in RPI device edit)  
	this is useful to set a GPIO as fast as possible after boot before all networks, vars, etc are finished.. saves ~ 15 secs  
	done in /home/pi/pibeacon/doGPIOatStartup.py called by /home/pi/callbeacon.py  ..called by rc.local after boot  
	doGPIOatStartup is setup by master with the options set in RPI device edit  

3. added state "actualGpioValue" to OUTPUT-GPIO on/off devices.  
	This will set the actual value of the GPIO on the RPI, msg send from rpi to the plugin.   
	It will be refreshed after GPIO is set from plugin and checked every 90 secs or if changed   
	useful if your GPIUO is set by other means or after a reboot the GPIOs might not be set properly  

4. added RPI device state "closest iBeacon". it will show eg b-xy-volvo-keys-turcoise@0.2 = name@distance.
	you can set cutoff distance (ignore if distance > xx) in PRI device edit
	you can set ignore THIS iBeacon for this feature in iBeacon device edit.
	how to use it in an action (python code), trigger on any chage of dev/state
		yyyy = indigo.devices["name of your rpi"].states
		xxx = yyyy["closestiBeacon"]
		if xxx.find("@")>-1:  
			nameOfBeacon = xxx.split("@")[0]
			distToRPI    = float(xxx.split("@")[1])
			indigo.server.log(" closest beacon to RPi is "+nameOfBeacon+" at distance of "+str(distToRPI))
			# do something with dist
			if distToRPI < 3: 
				indigo.server.log("beacon is very close" )
		else:
			indigo.server.log("no iBeacon is close" )
   

5. added option in menu to restart master.py in case it hangs ... 


x. will deprecate devices OUTPUT-GPIO-4,8,12,16,.. should all be changed to device type OUTPUT-GPIO-1-on-off
	it is to complicated to manage all the states and which one to use for status and is more in line with std Indigo philosophy
